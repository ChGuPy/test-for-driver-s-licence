# test-for-driver-s-licence
Just a web app where you have to answer a questions. You can add questions, add answers and mark some of them as right or wrong. 
I am using q/a from gai.eu.com. Best regards to them :) 
P.S I have no driver licence :D 

First of all: I push sqlite db with already existing questions/answers. All q/a at russian language.
If you going to use it you need:
1) Go to admin site  with Login: admin, Password: github123
2) Add new user so user could sign in on index page
3) Or just sign in as admin on index page.

If you dont know russian, just leave database, create superuser, add q/a about anything you wish.

Every time you start test again all previous progress override for same user.
You can also  change this behavior in templates.
